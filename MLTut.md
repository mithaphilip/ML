- **A smart Predictor using Machine Learning**

    - INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING
    You can make your program predict with reference to observations from the past. Machine Learning is an exciting field where your program learns and then predict results. The section focusses primarily on concepts that makes up the field of Machine Learning.  
      
    - NAIVE BAYES
      Naive Bayes classifiers works great for applications such as document classification , spam filtering. The supervised algorithms are based on the Bayes' theorem which deals with probability of an occurence, based on conditions related to it.
      
    - SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
      SVM or Support Vector Machines uses supervised learning method. It is used for 'yes or no' prediction (that is a classification problem), for a system which provides predicted results - helping with information on 'How much' or 'how many'(technically termed as Regression). 
      
    - DECISION TREES
      Decision Trees are easier to understand / interpret. It defines a model that uses observations from several input values and predicts the value of the target variable. The model is commonly used for classification  and regression.
      
    - CLUSTERING
      Clustering uses an unsupervised learning method. It assigns the input to a subset called a  cluster, which has values that are similar in some manner. A few of its applications include statistical data analysis, identification of cancer detection, search engines.
    
    - FEATURE SELECTION
      Feature selection uses the most relevant attributes from the input set. Feature selection also called as variable selection,attribute selection helps to reduce training time, simplifies your predictor model.
      
    - PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
      Principal component analysis or PCA deals with a dimension reduction concept, where a large set of input data is reduced to its smaller version but still holds most of the information in the larger set.
      
    
- **TENSOR FLOW**
    - INTRODUCTION TO TENSOR FLOW
      Tensor Flow is an open source machine learning software library used to program the numerical computations that machine learning projects deal with. The computations are graphs in tensor flow. Deep Learning and Neural Network together works best for applications that involve image / speech recognition, natural language processing. This section below includes varios topics that would help you define your own neural network model, activated using tensors in tensor flow. 

    - WORKING WITH TENSOR FLOW
       This section deals with a stepby step procedure to install tensor flow.      

    - TENSORS IN TENSOR FLOW 
      Tensors are used to represent data in tensor flow. Computation graph uses these tensors to do the computations. There are different types of tensors and they can be defined using rank, shape and type. This section provides with a basic understanding of how to program using tensors in tensor flow. 
    
    - DIGIT RECOGNITION USING TENSOR FLOW
      This section primarily focusses on understanding a neural network model using tensor flow. We would use the MNIST, a large dataset of handwritten digits for the purpose. MNIST digit recognition task is fundemental towards understanding-how to model a neural net using tensor flow. Our goal in this section would be to implement a neural model for the recognition process and to calculate the accuracy of our model.
      
    - CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
      Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is key towards most of the computer vision systems today and is held responsible for highly valued results in image classification problems. CNN in simple terms is multiple copies of the same neuron. This tutorial deals with basic understanding of a convolutional neural network and would also direct you to implement understand how to apply CNN to MNIST digit recognition task using tensor flow.
      
    - DEEP LEARNING NEURAL NETWORK
      Deep neural network deals with more than 3 layers of hidden neurons. The resulting features from the hidden layer are much complex features of the input, making the predictionmore accurate. This section deals with key concepts that forms deep learning neural network.
