    - INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING
    You can make your program predict with reference to observations from the past. Machine Learning is an exciting field where your program learns and then predict results. The section focusses primarily on concepts that makes up the field of Machine Learning.  
      
    - NAIVE BAYES
      Naive Bayes classifiers works great for applications such as document classification , spam filtering. The supervised algorithms are based on the Bayes' theorem which deals with probability of an occurence, based on conditions related to it.
      
    - SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
      SVM or Support Vector Machines uses supervised learning method. It is used for 'yes or no' prediction (that is a classification problem), for a system which provides predicted results - helping with information on 'How much' or 'how many'(technically termed as Regression).
